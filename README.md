# Connect 4 AI
This python code creates a version of the game, Connect4. It then goes about implementing Minimax algorithm based on multiple heuristics, along with configurable depth limits as a way to determine difficulty of the AI.

You can either play the game with an AI, or make an AI play against another AI.

Refer to the code for more details. The python notebook provides all the necessary comments to understand what each of the function does.
